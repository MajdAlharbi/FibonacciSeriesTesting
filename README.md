# 🧪 Fibonacci Series Testing Project

This repository contains a software testing project developed for the **CS386 - Software Testing** course at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University.

## 📘 Project Description

The goal of this project is to test a Java method `fibonacciCheaker(int inputNumber)` that checks whether a given number is part of the Fibonacci sequence. The testing process covers multiple test strategies including:

- Control Flow Graph and Edge-Pair Coverage
- JUnit Standard Testing
- JUnit Parameterized Testing
- **JUnit Theories Testing**
- Input Space Partitioning
- Code Coverage using Clover

## 🧠 JUnit Theories

A key component of this project is the use of JUnit Theories to validate the method under multiple input conditions. This included:
- Fibonacci numbers (expected: `true`)
- Non-Fibonacci numbers (expected: `false`)
- Negative numbers (expected: exception)
